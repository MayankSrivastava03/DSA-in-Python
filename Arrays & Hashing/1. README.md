# Arrays
Arrays are data structures that store a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. They are a fundamental part of most programming languages and provide a way to store multiple values of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory.

## Advantages: ##

* Efficient Access: Elements in an array can be accessed directly using their index, making access operations very efficient.
* Memory Efficiency: Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, which reduces memory overhead compared to other data structures that may require additional pointers or metadata.
* Iterating Over Elements: Arrays allow for easy iteration over all elements using loops, making it simple to perform operations on all elements.
* Random Access: Arrays support random access, meaning you can access any element in the array directly by its index.
* Simple Implementation: Arrays have a straightforward implementation, making them easy to understand and use.

## Array Limitations: ##

* Fixed Size: In many programming languages, arrays have a fixed size that is determined when the array is created. This means you cannot easily change the size of an array once it is created.
* Homogeneous Elements: Arrays typically store elements of the same data type, so you cannot store elements of different types in the same array.
* Memory Overhead: In some cases, arrays may have a small memory overhead due to additional metadata needed to manage the array.

Overall, arrays are a powerful and efficient data structure for storing and accessing collections of elements, especially when the size of the collection is known in advance.
